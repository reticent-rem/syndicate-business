			`You find James waiting for you just outside the spaceport bar. Against the steady patter of micrometeorites against the roof he tells you, "Working here on <origin> is one of the few jobs in the galaxy more dangerous than fighting pirates. And worse, because if a big meteorite decides to strike this station, there's basically nothing the miners can do about it except hope they see it coming." He turns to you with a grin. "But nonetheless, I think you might be interested in this idea."`

He notices your arrival and stands up to greet you. "<first>, this is Captain Marshall," James says as you shake his hand.

			`	"The first challenge," he continues, "will be finding which asteroids are valuable. The worthless asteroids are either brown and smooth or gray and spiky with no apparent orbit. It doesn't matter how long you shoot them, they won't be destroyed. Valuable asteroids will always orbit the star and have a range of colors and surface textures. If you're not sure which are which and you don't have an asteroid scanner to tell you, keep a look out for other miners to see what they're firing at.`
			`	"Generally speaking, the more valuable minerals are tougher to mine, either because they're harder to break apart, or they're less common and in more dangerous regions of the galaxy. Silicon breaks up quickly; you'll fill your hold in a hurry and the stuff is everywhere. Platinum or gold asteroids are more work; they're not as common in areas where the Navy watches your back, but you make several times the number of credits for the effort.`

Jobs always follow the trade routes and settled areas. Mining makes it profitable to explore the nooks and crannies of the hyperlanes. If the place you end up landing has an economy, they'll buy the minerals in your hold. Mainly though, it's about how you like to spend your time. Some captains like managing a trading fleet while others like to strike out on their own.`
			`	"Mining can be complex compared to running jobs or trading commodities. I learned that first hand after pirates disabled my ship when I was starting out and I worked aboard a mining ship while it was being repaired. Now that was a while back so I might be a little rusty, but I could try at answering any other questions you might have about mining."`

If you want to optimize your mining operations, however, you'll want a Mining Laser. Not only does it cut through asteroids faster, it's also more precise and preserves more minerals when the asteroid breaks apart. Some miners like to have a bit of combat flexibility by mining with Heavy Lasers, however.`
			`	"Aside from lasers, the most valuable tool is an asteroid scanner. They're expensive, but they connect into your navigation and targeting systems to point you towards minable asteroids. You can also set them to find the most valuable asteroids, which increases your profitability per run. After that, a tactical scanner will tell you how far away the asteroid is and show how much damage you're doing. An afterburner is good for chasing down fast moving asteroids or getting away from pirates without leaving the system. A ramscoop will let you refuel while mining, extend your exploration range, and allow you to be ready for a quick escape."`

			`	Jack's grin lights up his weathered face like lightning. Before you can react, he clasps your forearm in a visegrip that rattles your bones to their marrow. His hearty laugh echoes through the ship as he gives you a wrenching shake.`
			`	"Brilliant choice, Capt'n!," he continues shaking you. "We'll be richer than any gentlemen of fortune dare dream!"`
			`	Without another word, Jack pivots, map-sphere in hand, and boldly strides out of the cockpit. Still shaking, you hear his offbeat, lumbering footfalls echo and fade as he leaves the ship - gone, in only a moment.`
			choice
				`	(Wait on the ship.)`
				`	(Pursue Jack.)`
					goto pursuit
			`	You remain in the suddenly hushed cockpit as Jack disapeared with the map. Without it, there is no hope to uncover its secrets, let alone find whatever treasure it leads to. Minutes turn to hours that crawl by in silence.`

			`	You dart out of the <ship> to follow Jack's trail only to find no trace of the man. You push into the cramped corridors of Hawkins Rest and through what feels like countless doors, ducts, and turns beneath flickering lights, with no sign of Jack or the sphere. After fruitless hours of searching, you limp back to the ship weary and emptyhanded.`
			label hesback # maybe add another choice here to make it more despairing that Jack's ditched you with the map and hide his return a bit more?
			`	As the last echoes of hope fade, you hear powerful banging outside of your <model> before the latch is swung open. You turn to see Jack leaning in the doorway, grin wide, the map-sphere clutched in his rough hand, now with one of its seven keyholes prominently occupied.`
			`	He tosses it to you in a lazy arc, where it lands with a soft thud in your palm. "Plug that in yer nav-array, Capt'n," he jovially commands. "It'll light the way to a half dozen hideaways, as promised, including this one o course. Now, the trick to this here map is that ol Flint hid the keys in hideaways cross the galaxy. I can point to where ye need go, but its you that's got to uncover the hideaways now. I'll be at the spaceport, find me there, and I'll steer you to where our fortune lies."`
			# maybe choice here to ask questions?
			`	With that, Jack recedes back out of the <ship> once more, leaving you alone with the map-sphere's first secret unlocked, and a promise of treasure yet to come.`

# Mission if player opts out of Jack, to reveal other starting hideaways after landing on Hawkins Rest

"Pirate Intro IV: The Stockade" # repeatable mission to ask Jack about remaining regions (up to region heads what they want here: story seeds, common knowledge about the region, history, whatever) and general pirate info

"Pirate Intro V: My Sea Adventure" # Semi-repeatable (7 times, once for each region unlocked): After unlocking a region, 
# 1) Jack will tell you a bit of lore about a region (again up to region heads if they want something here or I can make this more about how Flint visited said region) 
# 2) And/or Jack will tell the player a progressing short history of the legendary pirate Flint
# By the end, the player will have a short story outlining the legend of Flint in their logbook

"Pirate Intro VI: Captain Silver" # After unlocking all regions and getting the last bit of story about Flint, the map is unlocked and the treasure's location revealed. Probably out of scope at least until the rest of this is settled.
# More for the future, but this could be:
# 1) Simple reveal of the treasure with a short mission describing the adventure/contents.
# 2) Treasure Island route of larger journey to treasure itself, a betrayal by Jack, more extensive fight, maybe journey to track him down, etc (this would probably be more pirate campaign-y route)
# 3) Dynamic-ish route:
# 	A) Finding all the parts of the treasure map invisibly unhides the hideaway the treasure is on (but the region stories in Part V giving hints to the location)
#	B) Getting to the hideaway's system, the unlocked treasure map reveals the hideaway
# 	C) Hideaway the treasure is booby trapped/behind puzzles, (with hints to the answers hidden/revealed within the "short history of the legendary pirate Flint"
